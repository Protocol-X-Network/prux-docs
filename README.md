## Fast, Stable, Decentralized.

PRUX is a scalable proof-of-stake platform that allows developers to leverage the upstream benefits of Ethereum and Bitcoin. PRUX is more decentralized than 90% of blockchains. This means that the features offered on the platform are very censorship resistant.

We are an independent blockchain that combines the best parts of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Simply put, our blockchain can accommodate revolutionary upgrades from both ecosystems. PRC20 tokens and NFT functionality are easily accessible. Send and receive multiple fungible and non-fungible tokens without paying huge gas fees. Mint NFTs with the PRUX blockchain for next to nothing. The possibilities are endless when the right technology meets an affordable price.

 Through [GitHub](https://github.com/Protocol-X-Network) it is possible to monitor the daily research and development work carried out by the entire our ecosystem.
